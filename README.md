## Lab Assignments

1. Project description
   DeepBlue EcoGuard tackles the rising issue of underwater waste with three key solutions: a YoloV8 Algorithm for precise waste detection, a rule-based 
    classifier for assessing aquatic habitat, and a Machine Learning model to classify water quality. The YoloV8 Algorithm, trained on 5000 images, detects         waste, while the rule-based classifier uses guidelines from the US EPA and WHO for habitat assessment. The Machine Learning model, trained on a dataset         of over 6 million rows, reliably classifies water as fit or unfit. This project offers a comprehensive approach to safeguard our oceans and marine life.
